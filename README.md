# DeepHacking Zsh Theme

`deephacking.zsh-theme` is a customizable Oh My Zsh theme specifically designed for pentesters, offering a clean and efficient prompt to streamline daily tasks during audits and penetration testing. The theme includes real-time display of the date, time, IP address, current directory, and the result of the last executed command. The inclusion of date and time is particularly useful for reporting, allowing pentesters to clearly track when tests were executed, making it easier to document results. Additionally, the theme provides flexibility for manual or automatic IP configuration, custom symbols, and other features tailored to enhance a pentester's workflow.

## Features

- **Real-time Date and Time**: Display the current date and time in cyan for easy readability.
- **Dynamic IP Address**: Automatically show the IP from a specific interface (e.g., `tun0`) or manually set an IP.
  - Set IP manually or automatically using the `setip` function.
  - Toggle showing the IP with `enableip` and `disableip` commands.
- **Command Execution Status**: 
  - A white `❯` symbol indicates successful command execution.
  - A red `❯` symbol shows when the previous command failed.
  - If the user is `root`, the prompt shows `#` in red.
- **Current Directory**: The prompt shows the current working directory within brackets in red and white.
- **Customizable Interface**: Easily switch between displaying an IP from an interface or a manually set IP address.
